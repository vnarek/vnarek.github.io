Hi,

it's me, I mean you. I am writing from the distant future to tell you about my cultural norms and stuff I am sure you are doing morally wrong.

// I didn't include veganism, animal-welfare, wild animal suffering or effective-altruism themes in general, because
// I already believe that veganism and charitable giving is something we ought to do.

* We live in anarchist society and state oppression and non-aggression principle violations of your times is seen as really wrong.

* We are funding long-term research to make sure that people in the future are living happy and full-filling lives. 

* Additionally excessive usage of memory in programming languages and writing non-optimal code is deemed immoral. You need to write code that is not bloated. Same is true for writing code in a non-functional way.

* That your society made people suffer, without a way out. Not permitting people to end their lives, when the situation is unreversable.

* You should give more attention to general A.I research, because not doing so is pretty reckless.
