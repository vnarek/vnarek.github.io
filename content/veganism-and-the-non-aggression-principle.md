title: Veganism and the non-aggression principle
---
* For Urza to respect animals' will to live without constant infliction of suffering on them animals need to understand the [Non aggression principle](None).
* It is the symmetry breaker between humans and animals for Urza and for me, that sounds ridiculous
* He does not even care if animals would respect the non-aggression principle without understanding its intricacies. Most of them do that, and they attack humans because they are scared. Even if it's unfortunate that animals do that I find that it is justified to defend ourselves and kill them.
* This is currently not the case for factories or any other type of farm. I would even say that this makes us worse than animals because we can understand the harm we are causing them and we are still choosing to participate (do we actually respect the NAP?)
* Additionally, a human being who understands the NAP and breaks it is treated in a better way than an animal that does not understand it and doesn't breach it.
* But let us suppose this is the real symmetry breaker, even though it seems really arbitrary
	* There are humans that are not going to be able to understand NAP like severely disabled humans
	* Should we be able to farm those humans in factories?
	* More hypothetically imagine humans just like us that just do not understand the concept of NAP, on our intelligence level, our level of suffering, a family that cares for them
		* If Urza says this is not possible ask in which way it is impossible. Is it logically impossible or physically?
