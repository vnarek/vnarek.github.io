title: Effective vegan advocacy
---
Is type of advocacy, which prefers evidence-based outreach methods, even if those methods are less pure or those methods are not strictly talking about [vegan](veganism.md) arguments.

It focuses less on strong [moral](morality.md) groundings and arguments for veganism and shifts towards effective messaging, behavioral psychology, understanding [carnism](carnism.md) etc.

I see Effective vegan advocacy as part of the [effective altruism](effective-altruism.md) movement.
