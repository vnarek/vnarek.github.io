## Authors

* Podcast is ran by IMV, Czech publication regarding healthy nutrition
	* Read some articles from them regarding [Veganism](veganism.md). Their points seemed mostly valid, except for philosophy of Veganism (not understanding we don't really care about what is natural, but about animal suffering) and Vegan pet food (this is more underwhelming, because it is related to nutrition albeit for non-human animals)
* Martin Haranta
	* He is presented as a renowned expert, but I was not impressed when I had look into his credentials nor previous work.
	* Bachelor in economics and Masters degree after 6 years in Open University
		* This itself is not a problem I think generalist do exist and he has some online course regarding Microbiome from the Harvard
	* Has section about publications he did, there are 3 scientific publications
		* First one is published in an InTech Open journal, which is described as predatory journal as it takes fees, but does not do a good due diligence in their peer reviews. What is even more troublesome is that there is not reported conflict of interest even though Martin 
		* Second one is actually not written by Martin, but instead it's a review for posters on a academic session Martin attended, it contains just a review of his poster

## Content

Based on this I am pretty skeptical of the host and people running the podcast from the get go tbh.

I am not really equipped to asses if the information that was said there is true as this is not my field of expertise. It seems like probiotics research is in it's infancy and additional quality research needs to exist for the supplements. I mostly checked information available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic), Mayo Clinic and Harvard Health. Probiotics are also available in fermented food (kimchi, kefir, yoghurt etc.).

Mayo Clinic does actually something similar to the company Martin is workin for as part of their [center for individualized medicine](https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/pillars-programs/microbiomics).
