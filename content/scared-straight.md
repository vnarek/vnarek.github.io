Scared Straight is a TV series that sends young delinquents to the prison for 3 hours to disincentivize them from the wrong path.

Scientific research shows that this kind of social program to prevent delinquent behavior is not only ineffective, but actually defective.

Even thought scientific research suggest it's not a good idea to continue with this, the program is still run.
