title: New European immigration pact
draft: "true"
---
This note contains my research into the new immigration pact and European immigration in general (mostly from 2013 onward). I should declare beforehand that I see immigration as a positive thing in general, I feel it is a net benefit for people in the country most of the time when we have a sane implementation of the immigration policy and it is an enormous benefit for people migrating from poorer countries both for economical and safety reasons. It is possible that this bias would arise somewhere in this written text.

This text is also written from the perspective of a Czech citizen, who was mostly unaffected by the immigration/border crisis in the EU. This unawareness can be both a good and bad thing. I don't have first-hand experience, but at the same time, I can probably analyze the issue much easier from an unbiased perspective. Lastly I am myself an immigrant, who's family came to the Czech republic in the beginning of the 2000s, because of both ongoing war and the prospect of economic prosperity in EU.

# Why did I start to look into this?
One of our main opposition political parties created [ANO petitions in 2024](ano-petitions-in-2024.md) and I was interested in this subject for a long time. Three articles deep and I figured out that my understanding of the subject was not deep enough to make an informed decision. The messiness of the situation intrigued me so I started digging.

# What caused the immigration crisis in Europe 2015
The immigration crisis didn't started because of ideological brain rot, nor because Germany just let the migrants in to change the culture in Europe, nor jews. My understanding why immigration crisis happened is influx of a lot of immigrants into the bordering countries, which highly overwhelmed both first contact countries and the system. At the same time we cannot deny asylum seekers, because of international conventions that were signed to ensure safe harbors for people running from places where war erupt.

People seeking immigration came and signed for asylum, by the rules of Dublin regulation the first country to detect the irregular entry needs to start the asylum process. The European union states did not detect these evenly as most people came from the south getting caught in the countries like Italy, Greece. They worked as an [rate-limiter](None), which was not working correctly and enabling the influx to [DDOS](ddos.md) the whole Europe. As there was no agreements on to better distribute these people some European countries took more people to alleviate from the critical masses in Greece, Italy etc. and some countries (for example countries in Visegr√°d Group) did not take almost any refugees.

Terrorist attacks in France and Brussel radicalized voter base even more, creating breeding ground for far-right parties over the Europe, which made finding some compromise even less probable.
