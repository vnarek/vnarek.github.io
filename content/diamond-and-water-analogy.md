### Question
What's more valuable? Diamond or water?

### Answer
It depends. If we live in a place where's a high water scarcity, then water is much more valuable (because average price of water is higher). But in places where water is freely available for anyone that has a tap, then getting diamonds is more valuable because of so called [Marginal utility](marginal-utility.md).
