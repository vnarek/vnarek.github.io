title: What now? Different choices after college
---
I need to fill my free time after finishing my master's and I would like to fill it in interesting ways. This page is going to list some interesting ways I would like to do that.

There are both highly time-consuming activities that I need to do for longer periods of time and small, one-off activities I just want to try.

### Bucket like list

* [ ] Create our own custom macchiato cups from scratch using clay.
* [ ] My former colleague did that somewhere near the place I live, and I would love to try that because of my coffee addiction*
* [ ] Debate the Urza about veganism / morality of Ancap
	* [ ] [Debate preparation](None)
* [x] Some travelling (Portugal, Greece, maybe southern Italy again)
* [ ] Create a game about surfing

### Long term strategy

* Travelling
* Singing, playing instrument
* Resume to donating money
	* [Where should I donate now?](where-should-i-donate-now.md)
* Improve writing
	* Create a substack?
* Read, read, read!
