### The Logic of Effective Altruism

This article contains a case for EA movement given by Peter Singer and then there are some critics, which are trying to argument against the EA.

This review is going to try rebut some of the arguments given against Effective Altruism movement in the article.

#### Angus Deaton
* Effective altruism is more of a movement and it's implementation can be changed, if we find that other ways of helping are more effective.
* States don't pursue EA goals right now and their foreign aid is pretty limited . There's no real benefit in foreign aid for your ability to be reelected if people of your country don't care about foreign aid.

#### Daron Acemoglu
* What to do if state doesn't do it's job. I think it's similar argument to poor working conditions in developing world. Yeah we could not support those firms by not buying our clothes there, but what about the people? I think it's good to create competition to the state.
* Effective altruism is not creating any meaning judgements, but just working inside your meaning framework. If part of your meaning for life consists of helping others, then EA is just saying do this thing instead if you really value helping others.

#### Jennifer Rubenstein
* Democracy is a mean not an end
