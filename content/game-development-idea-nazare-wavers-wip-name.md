title: Game development idea - Nazare wavers (WIP name)
---
* I went to Portugal this year and tried surfing for the first time in my life
* It was really fun and difficult. At the start, I was not even able to lie on the board
* Even though I did not manage to surf any waves that day the mere impossibility motivated me to go on and on until we were forced to return the boards and suits
* I would like to emulate the feeling in this game
	* Make it hard from the get-go, with no time for the user to get accustomed to the controls it must feel like learning how to surf
	* When you start getting a grip on the game you can unlock more and more stuff to do, not by changing the maps, but by getting better and better at controlling the surfer
* There should still be some different places, maybe modeled by the real places where surfers go (from smaller to bigger waves)
* Or we could create fantasy places

### Mechanics?
