- PlayPump was an altruistic project, which designed a new type of pumps to help people in developing world (mainly Africa).
- It tried to do so by developing pump that uses children play power to pump water out of the ground
- This project failed, because no one really sat down and research possible drawback
- Some of those drawbacks were
	- **It wasn't fun for children to play on it, because the momentum used to spin them was allocated to pump the water out of the ground**
	- **It was less optimal than the classic pump, so there was more work for women to do to get the same amount of water**
	- Children were sometimes paid to play on it (is it really that bad tho?)
	- Women felt less dignified and it was a nuisance
	- Advertisements on the billboard near the pump were blank
- Even though after review of this given charity we found it doesn't help people are giving money to it via. *Roundabout Water Solutions Fieldâ€™s*
- This is a nice example of [Deffective altruism](deffective-altruism.md)
