## Who am I? TLDR;

* I am a computer science student
* I am interested in:
	* Philosophy (mostly [Ethics](None))
	* Relationship advice
	* Computer Science and [Machine Learning](None)
	* Rationality and truth seeking
	* A lot of things that I know nothing about

This is mostly my personal knowledge base, where you can peek into my ðŸ§  and see what's going on there.
