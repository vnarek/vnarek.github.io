* We, as human beings do not optimize for the well-being of non-human animals in factory farming
* Our [Cost function](None) cares mostly about nutrition and taste of the food we eat and we are able to exploit that by making farming really effective
* But there is no free lunch and this effectiveness is gotten by sacrificing well-being of fellow non-human animals
* Describe what we do to them
* We are unaligned to values of other animals

* Is the factory farming good parallel to [Unaligned A.I](None)? 
	* Yes, because in both cases some [Agent](None) is optimizing for it's goals, being indifferent to values of other animals.
* It's important to make sure that this does not happen with A.I
