# Introduction

As an Armenian, it feels wrong to not understand the broader context of the war that shaped the lives of my family so tremendously. My father fought in this war before he hit his twenties, got married, had me, and left for a brighter future for his children to Europe. This is my view of the situation and maybe he feels differently, but I am really glad this happened. When the second Nagorno-Karabakh war started I was finishing my university in contrast to my peers and friends who went to fight and die in this war.

Even though the war itself did not directly affect me in any way I feel it makes sense for me to understand why this war happened in greater detail. At the same time, I don't want my understanding to be heavily biased towards the Armenian narrative. I don't want to defend the actions of my country if I don't believe in the rightness of the actions. I don't hate Azerbaijani or Turkish people for their historical ills towards Armenia. I just want to understand if the war is legitimate, and what are the ways to resolve the conflict for the greater benefit of all participating sides. I mourn for young people dying without fulfilling their true potential and I don't care what nationality are they.

My sources are mostly going to be based on the book from 2003 called [Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86320.Black_Garden). I will also read some critiques of the book, but because the conflict is effectively still ongoing I would take the critiques from both Azerbaijani and Armenian sources with a grain of salt.

My stance on the war, in general, is that it is a [Molochian](moloch.md) failure to coordinate, and that it is wrong. But that does not mean there is a side that is doing wrong. Both sides can be justified in pursuing the war or even have good reasons to do it. I would like to understand if that is the case in this conflict.

The context of the introduction is not of high epistemic level and it was written before I started researching. I wanted to document my initial reasons for researching this topic and I will not change this introduction even after a better understanding of the situation. Linked articles on the other hand can be and will be changed.

Lastly, even though I love Armenian culture, legacy, traditions, and language I am not a nationalistic person, and my morals are more closely aligned to the more common individualism of European states.

With all of this in mind, let's jump into the questions.

## Why there is a war?

This question is dependent on the time frame through which we want to have a look into the conflict. In 1988 a demonstration took place in Stepanakert, which was organized by the Armenian Soviet party that demanded that Nagorno Karabakh be amended to the Armenian Soviet state from the Azerbaijani Soviet state. The demonstrations were peaceful, but the sheer numbers scared a lot of people in both Kreml and Azerbaijan leaderships. These demonstrations were unprecedented at the time and were only allowed to happen because of the new [Policies that Gorbachov made](perestroika.md). The people of Armenia thought that this would be a fast process and that Nagorno-Karabakh would be allowed to join Armenia by the Soviets. This did not happen, but the pandora's box of national hatred was already opened.

This is most of the time dated as the beginning of the modern Karabakh dispute between the nations but the book suggests that the tensions started already in the fall of 1987, when the first occurrence of inter-ethic violence took place. Armenians got beaten up by the police in Chardakhlu which is a part of North Azerbaijan in October 1987 and soon after that two train wagons of people from Armenian cities Meghri and Kafan got displaced and arrived in Baku, beaten up.

From what I've read I think that if these steps described in the last two paragraphs did not happen the war would probably not have come to be. It is much easier to say this in hindsight when we know that the Soviets will not take the side of the Armenian people. From my perspective, these asks were not justified from the Armenian side. I think we should respect the sovereignty of countries and their borders except in catastrophic scenarios, even in cases where there is a huge diaspora of people from a different nation living there (Krym). I can understand why Armenians would want to get this land in this case having the historical context of the genocide that happened in 1915.

## Pogrom in Sumgait

Even though the policies of the Soviets were in favor of Nagorno-Karabakh remaining under Azerbaijani rule the situation created a distrust in Azerbaijani people towards soviet rule and Armenians, additionally people that got displaced from Armenian cities were angry the tensions raised in Baku, and the Armenian people living there were in danger. Fortunately, the leaders of the capital were able to keep their Armenian community safe, by blockading the city and watching over the neighborhoods over the night.

Unfortunately, the same thing did not happen in the city called Sumgait near Baku. In the pogrom, plenty of people were killed, raped. Their belongings were stolen or broken. The book goes into vivid details I don't want to go into, based on recalls from survived Armenians and interviews that were done at that time. I would like to say demographics of the people, who did the pogrom are not representative of the overall Azerbaijanis. They were poorer / lower-class people who got displaced and before lived in more rural areas. A lot of Armenians were saved by Azerbaijanis, who hid them in their houses or protected them in other ways.
