title: Where should I donate now?
---
I stopped donating. The reason for that was simple it became harder to have a continuous flow of income when I was finishing my master's. Now when I am finally labeled as an Ing. I want to continue with my generous spending.

When I started donating money in early 2021 my reasons were mostly based on [Utilitarian](None) calculus. I felt that the marginal utility I get from the additional spending is unjustifiable when considering the global scale of suffering and existential risks. I am less utilitarian in my views nowadays, but still, this calculation plays an important role in my behavior. The question is how to effectively donate to charities now after almost 2 years and what shall be the recipients of my donations?

### Which platform to use?

I want to be able to track my donations effectively and see some basic metrics for selfish reasons. Additionally, I want to give as much of my money as possible to charity, which means that the transfer should be with minimal fees.

I used [every.org](https://every.org) in the past and gave some more using [givingwhatwecan.org](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/). Both platforms worked really well for my use case. I would use givingwhatwecan.org, but they are not tax-deductible in the Czech Republic, which means I can potentially give more for less money ðŸ’™. There is [effektiv-spenden.org](https://effektiv-spenden.org) in Germany, which provides most of the effective charities in a way that is tax-deductible in Czechia and they provide charities I would send my money to either way.

### How am I going to allocate my money?

I will start slowly and try to donate 7% recurrently from my pay-check and the allocation is going to be equally distributed between:

* [ACEs Recommended Charity Fund](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund)
* [Give Wells All Grants Fund](https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants)
* [The Global Catastrophic Risks Fund](https://founderspledge.com/funds/global-catastrophic-risks)

An additional 3% of my paycheck is going to be used for possible matching donation challenges (I will reroute all the money if it's possible for that month to donate more).
