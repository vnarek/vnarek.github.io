Hi,

forgive me my rather weird word choices, but language is not the only thing that is pretty different in the future. I am writing this letter in 2022 more than 200 years since you have been born. I would like to challenge your notions about what is right and wrong.

In your times slavery is still pretty well perceived, but I think we can agree that perception of what's good is not a good metric for morality. It was perceived that raping women, sacrificing humans and cannibalism were amoral actions.

Let me give you a thought experiment. Imagine that you are given chance to develop a world, in which you can design how the system will work from the god's point of view. You are then going to spawn in that world at some point of time, but the catch is that you don't know anything about what race are you gonna be. Would you design a system that enslaves black man, if there is a chance that your system is going to put a chain around your foot?

If the answer is no, please reconsider your view of your fellow humans.

Thank you and good luck,

Narek
