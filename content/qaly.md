- **QALY** is a metric used to rate health interventions and can be used for charity work also
- It takes into account differences between how long would patient live and how enjoyable his live would be
- It helps us to get more informed about different sacrifices we make when helping

### How to compute

- If we could extend someones life by 5 years with level of enjoyment of 7/10 then we would assign 3.5 **QALY** to that intervention
- If we could extend someones enjoyment of the life to 90% over the period of 10 years then we would assign 9 **QALY** to that intervention
- What if someone is going to die after 5 years with quality of life at 30% and by treatment we would increase his lifespan to 12 years with quality of life at 70%. Then the **QALY** for that intervention would be $(0.7 - 0.3) * 5 + 0.7 * 7 = 6.9$.
