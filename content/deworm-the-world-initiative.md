- Founded by Michael Kremer and Rachel Glennerster
- They tried to improve African kids education
- Michael Kremer suggested to use randomized controlled trial to find the most effective strategy to help kids
- They tried numerous things that did not work out
	- More students books
	- Flip books
	- More teachers
- After some time his friend suggested that he should test **deworming**, which is a medical treatment not even related to education.
- This was found to be very effective at improving children's attendance in school, because they were less sick
