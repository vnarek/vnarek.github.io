Article: **Welfare reform and the family cap: Rhetoric versus reality**

This article establishes after decade long research that [Family Cap](family-cap.md) does not decrease birth rates among poor women.

It is a review of the available literature.

Notable ones are the: 
* [New Jersey Study on Family Caps](new-jersey-study-on-family-caps.md)

Additionally this review is trying to give another hypothesis, which is much more cross-sectional and links multiple social hooks that could cause the increase of birthrates over years.

* Cuttings in the planned parenthood
* Less job opportunities for fathers
* Social norm changes around divorce and single-mother children

These are more linked to out-of-wedlock births than overall births.
