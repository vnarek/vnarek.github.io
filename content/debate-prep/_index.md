Three years back I wrote an email to Urza about veganism, after reading his article about [veganism](https://stoky.urza.cz/texty/nap-a-veganstvi-602). He said that he cannot reply to me now, but if I want, we can have a debate about that on his channel. I suspect there is going to be some spillover into anarcho-capitalism as it's always the case with Urza.

## What should we debate?

* [Veganism and the non-aggression principle](veganism-and-the-non-aggression-principle.md)
* [Justification for the state and taxes on moral grounds](justification-for-the-state-and-taxes-on-moral-grounds.md)
